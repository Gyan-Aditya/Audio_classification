📝 README for Audio Classification Model
🎵 Audio Classification using Machine Learning
This repository contains an audio classification model built using TensorFlow/Keras and Librosa for feature extraction. The model is trained on the UrbanSound8K dataset and deployed using Streamlit.

📌 Features
🎧 Classifies different environmental sounds (e.g., Dog Bark, Siren, Gunshot).
📊 Uses MFCC feature extraction for audio processing.
🧠 Trained using a deep learning model (CNN/MLP).
🌍 Deployed using Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.

🎤 How to Use
Upload an audio file (.wav, .mp3).
Model processes the audio and extracts features.
The model predicts the sound category and displays the result.
Enjoy the animation when a prediction is made! 🎉
